# The one with the master stroke theorem
The intention of this project is to re-live the magical Central Limit Theorem.
I have taken a dataset of more than 100,000 diabetic patients and estimated the average number of days spent in the hospital.

Focus is laid to re-assert the below:
a. Regardless of the shape of the population distribution, sampling distribution of the sample means attains a normal distribution if sample size is sufficiently large (preferably >= 30).
b. The variance of the sampling distribution decreases with the increase in sample size.
c. The estimated mean approaches population mean with the increase in sample size.

Description of the files:
Central-Limit-Theorem.Rmd - R markdown file that contains the source code of the project
Output images folder: This is where the output of the R-code is stored. One can quickly skim through these files to get a hang of what the project is trying to do.
