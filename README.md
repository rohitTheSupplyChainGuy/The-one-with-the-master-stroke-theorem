# The one with the master stroke theorem
The intention of this project is to re-live the magical Central Limit Theorem.
I have taken a dataset of more than 100,000 diabetic patients and estimated the average number of days spent in the hospital.

Focus is laid to re-assert the below:
a. Regardless of the shape of the population distribution, sampling distribution of the sample means attains a normal distribution if sample size is sufficiently large (preferably >= 30).
b. The variance of the sampling distribution decreases with the increase in sample size.
c. The estimated mean approaches population mean with the increase in sample size.
